# 🚀 Hackmate

**Hackmate** is a swipe-based matchmaking platform designed to help founders and builders discover potential co-founders, collaborators, or indie hackers to work with — Tinder-style.

No social profiles, no fluff. Just raw experience, aligned intent, and mutual interest.

## 🧠 What is Hackmate?

A real-time matchmaking app where users:

- Create a profile with their skillset, experience, and goals
- Swipe right to express interest in working with someone
- Get matched if there's a mutual right swipe
- View new matches in a dynamic queue

Hackmate is built for fast, low-friction connections in startup ecosystems, hackathons, and builder communities.

## 🧱 Redis Store Structure

| Key Purpose       | Redis Type | Key Format          | Example Usage            |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Likes Given       | `SET`      | `likes:<user_id>`    | Prevent duplicate swipes |
| Match Queue       | `LIST`     | `matches:<user_id>`  | Fetch mutual matches     |
| User Profiles     | `HASH`     | `user:<user_id>`     | Cached basic user info   |

> Compatibility scores and seen/blocked users are handled through API logic, not Redis.
